# Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders of the CourseWagon community pledge to make participation in our project and community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy community focused on advancing educational technology and AI-powered learning.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment for our community include:

* Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people
* Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
* Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
* Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes, and learning from the experience
* Focusing on what is best not just for us as individuals, but for the overall community
* Supporting and mentoring new contributors
* Celebrating the successes of fellow community members
* Maintaining a collaborative and educational mindset

### Unacceptable Behavior

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

* The use of sexualized language or imagery, and sexual attention or advances of any kind

* Public or private harassment
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or email address, without their explicit permission
* Dismissing or attacking someone based on their level of experience or education
* Spamming, flooding, or deliberately disrupting discussions
* Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behavior
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional or educational setting

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, including but not limited to:

* GitHub repositories (issues, pull requests, discussions, code reviews)
* Communication channels (email, chat platforms, forums)
* Project documentation and wikis
* Social media accounts representing the project
* Community events (virtual or in-person)

This Code of Conduct also applies when an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces, such as using an official email address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event.

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Community leaders and project maintainers are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

Community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned with this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation decisions when appropriate.

## Reporting Guidelines

### How to Report

If you experience or witness unacceptable behavior, or have any other concerns, please report it by:
