# What's the problem?

**The Infinite Loop of Outdated Learning**

The issue that drives us crazy is the **massive disconnect between the speed of technology and the speed of our curriculum updates**.

Every semester, we face the same struggle: we sign up for a course like "Web Development" or "AI", only to be handed a syllabus that is effectively a time capsule from three years ago. The professors are brilliant, but they are overwhelmed. Updating a course to include the latest frameworks (like Angular 19 or Gemini 2.0) requires rewriting hundreds of pages of notes, slides, and assignments. It’s a full-time job on top of their full-time job.

For students, this creates a **"Resource Scavenger Hunt"**. Instead of learning from our course materials, we are forced to ignore them and spend hours trawling through documentation, YouTube tutorials, and Stack Overflow just to learn the *actual* current standards. We aren't studying; we are filtering noise. The library is full of students stressing out not because the concepts are hard, but because finding a coherent, up-to-date explanation for them is a nightmare.

This inefficiency is maddening. We have the world's information at our fingertips, yet compiling it into a structured learning path takes weeks of manual labor for educators and students alike. We are stuck in an infinite loop of learning yesterday's technology because creating today's content is too slow.

**CourseWagon** solves this by automating the grunt work. By using AI to instantly generate structured, up-to-date course content, we eliminate the lag between innovation and education. We stop the scavenger hunt and let students focus on what matters: learning.
