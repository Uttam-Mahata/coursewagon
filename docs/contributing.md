## Development Guidelines

### Frontend (Angular)

**Component structure:**
```typescript
@Component({
  selector: 'app-feature',
  standalone: true,
  imports: [CommonModule],
  templateUrl: './feature.component.html',
  styleUrls: ['./feature.component.css']
})
export class FeatureComponent implements OnInit, OnDestroy {
  // Implementation
}
```

**Best practices:**
- Use standalone components
- Implement OnDestroy for cleanup
- Use async pipe when possible
- Type everything with TypeScript
- Write unit tests

### Backend (Python/FastAPI)

**Endpoint structure:**
```python
@router.get("/endpoint/{id}")
async def get_resource(
    id: int,
    db: Session = Depends(get_db),
    current_user: dict = Depends(get_current_user)
) -> ResourceResponse:
    """
    Get resource by ID.
    
    Args:
        id: Resource identifier
        db: Database session
        current_user: Authenticated user
        
    Returns:
        Resource object
        
    Raises:
        HTTPException: If resource not found
    """
    # Implementation
```

**Best practices:**
- Use type hints
- Write docstrings
- Handle errors properly
- Use dependency injection
- Write tests

---

## Testing Guidelines

### Frontend Testing

**Unit tests:**
```typescript
describe('CourseService', () => {
  it('should fetch courses', () => {
    // Test implementation
  });
});
```

**Component tests:**
```typescript
describe('CourseListComponent', () => {
  it('should create', () => {
    expect(component).toBeTruthy();
  });
});
```

### Backend Testing

**API tests:**
```python
def test_get_courses(client, auth_headers):
    response = client.get("/api/courses", headers=auth_headers)
    assert response.status_code == 200
    assert isinstance(response.json(), list)
```

**Integration tests:**
```python
def test_course_creation_flow(client, auth_headers):
    # Test complete flow
    pass
```
