## AI Content Generation

### How does AI content generation work?

CourseWagon uses Google Gemini AI (gemini-2.0-flash model) to generate educational content. You provide the course topic, and AI generates:
- Relevant subjects
- Detailed topics
- Comprehensive lesson content with examples, diagrams, and exercises

### How accurate is the AI-generated content?

Google Gemini AI is highly capable, but:
- **Always review** generated content for accuracy
- **Use as a starting point** and supplement with authoritative sources
- **Subject matter expertise** is still valuable
- **Regenerate** if content doesn't meet your needs

### Why is content generation taking so long?

**Normal generation times:**
- Subjects: 10-30 seconds
- Topics: 15-45 seconds
- Content: 30-90 seconds

**If it's taking longer:**
- High API usage (wait and try again)
- Large content generation
- Network connectivity issues
- Server load

### Content generation failed. What should I do?

**Try these steps:**
1. Refresh the page
2. Wait a moment and try again
3. Check your internet connection
4. Try generating fewer items at once
5. Contact support if problem persists

### Can I edit AI-generated content?

Manual content editing is coming in a future release. Currently, you can:
- Regenerate content to get different results
- Content is stored as Markdown (editable in database)
- Future releases will have in-app editor

### How many subjects/topics should I generate?

**Recommended:**
- **Subjects**: 5-10 per course
- **Topics**: 5-15 per subject

More isn't always better! Focus on quality and logical organization.

### Can I generate content in different languages?

Currently, content is primarily generated in English. Multi-language support is planned for future releases.

---

## Content Rendering

### Why aren't my math equations displaying correctly?

**Common issues:**
- Incorrect LaTeX syntax
- Missing dollar signs ($  or $$)
- Browser compatibility

**Solutions:**
```markdown
# Inline math
The equation $E = mc^2$ is famous.

# Display math
$$
\frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}
$$
```

Use Chrome or Firefox for best compatibility.

### Diagrams aren't rendering. What's wrong?

**For Mermaid diagrams:**
1. Verify syntax is correct
2. Refresh the page
3. Check browser console for errors
4. Try regenerating content

**Example working diagram:**
````markdown
```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Start] --> B[Process]
    B --> C[End]
```
````

### Code blocks don't have syntax highlighting

**Ensure you specify the language:**
````markdown
```python
def hello():
    print("Hello, World!")
```
````

Supported: Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, Java, C++, HTML, CSS, SQL, and more.

### How do I add images to content?

Currently, image upload is available through the image upload feature. AI can also generate images for topics. Manual image insertion in content is coming in a future release.
