### Working with AI Generation

**For Better AI Results:**

- Content: ~30-90 seconds

### Content Organization

1. **Start with Course Structure**
   - Create course
   - Generate/add subjects
   - Generate/add topics
   - Then generate content

2. **Progressive Development**
   - Don't generate all content at once

   - This saves time and resources

3. **Review and Iterate**
   - Review AI-generated subjects
   - Adjust order for logical flow
   - Regenerate content if needed

The AI (Google Gemini) is highly capable and generates quality educational content. However:
- Always review generated content for accuracy
- Use it as a starting point
- Supplement with authoritative sources
- Regenerate if content isn't suitable

### Can I edit generated content?

Currently, you can regenerate content but manual editing is coming soon. For now:
- Regenerate to get different content
- Content is saved in Markdown format
- Manual editing feature planned for future release

### How many courses can I create?

There's no limit! Create as many courses as you need.

### Is my content private?

Yes, your courses are private by default:
- Only you can see and edit your courses
- No one else can access your content
- You control all your educational material

### Can I export my content?

Export functionality is planned for a future release. It will support:
- Markdown export
- PDF export
- HTML export
